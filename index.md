I thought it might be useful to me, and hopefully to others, if I had a
place where I could record and share the occasional update or thought.

I've started by trying to write down my reactions to the movies I saw at
the New York Film Festival. I made it to 17 movies over two weeks and
have only jotted down thoughts about a few of them --- but even so it
helped me think harder about why I liked or disliked what I saw.

I'm also doing this because I'd wanted to learn more about static site
builders and markdown-based web site publishing.
