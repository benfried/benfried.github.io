The combination of elements is so powerful: detection, a quest for justice, underdog reporters and victims fighting entrenched authorities to get out an important and hard-won truth. Done right, the emotions it works with are really powerful: mystery, suspense, righteousness. And She Said does it right.\nIt could be argued that it’s not an inherently cinematic genre. That storytelling through the combination of moving image and sound is not advantaged by a form that centers on people who spend most of their effort on the phone or writing. In the abstract that argument might fly. But boy did my face flush in anger seeing the depictions of Weinstein’s victims. My pulse shot up when Weinstein entered the Times building. My head spun with excitement when sources came forward.\nEven knowing how things turned out, I couldn’t help but feel the suspense: would the reporters find someone willing to go on the record? What would Weinstein and his people do to stop the story from coming out? All over gain, I felt such rage at Weinstein and, even more, at the legions of people who helped him. 82 women have gone on the record as being victims of Weinstein.\nThe cast is uniformly terrific, especially the leads. It was a trip to see Megan Twohey on stage with Carey Mulligan, and to experience how much Mulligan became Twohey, nailing her voice and her mannerisms."

With the election of Ronald Reagan in the background, it’s a story about innocence lost, for Paul, the protagonist, as well as for America, about fitting in versus doing the right thing, about taking accountability.\nThat sounds heavy and moralistic, but it’s not. The story is so personal, and the performances so true, that it never feels didactic or preachy. The actors are excellent: you might think that the big stars would overrun something so intimate, but they don’t.

We see differences in race and class take two similar boys down two very different paths. But more importantly, I think, what makes it stand out is that every character is real: no one is all good or bad, almost everyone has good moments and not so good moments. There is so much understanding, so much texture.\nA number of Gray’s movies (Little Odessa, The Lost City of Z) have been on my “watch one day” list, but the only film of his I’d seen was Ad Astra. Ad Astra felt contemplative, deliberate, and, in my recollection, was an exercise in creating a sense of emotional isolation in the audience, mirroring Brad Pitt’s character’s, in turn a reflection of the loneliness, emptiness, and silence of space.\nAlthough both movies examine troubled father-son relationships, Armageddon Time could not be more different. It is full of warmth; it has empathy and compassion for complicated, flawed people. It wants its audience to understand the mix of good and and bad in its characters.\nI love movies that make me feel entertained. But, most entertainments leave an echo of adrenaline and little more. Armageddon Time made me feel like I had understood its characters, and that I had an emotional understanding of people, a moment in time, parts of a life. There’s something sort of magic about that."

    "text": "Goals\nI found out about quarto after learning about nbdev, which seems like a great all-in way to use Jupyter notebooks as a REPL+literate programming environment for python.\nOn nbdev: There's a lot to like there. All too often I find myself prototyping something in a notebook, then using some combination of export as python script or copy and paste to take what I figured out in the notebook and turn it into a standalone script. That process is often error-prone and it always feels more time-consuming than it should be.\nIn addition, as I continue to learn more about deep learning, the notebook workflow makes even more sense. The iteration cycle in ML is even more REPL-y than in other types of programming, as you're likely to have some expensive data operations up front that you want to experiment with without having to pay the price of those data loads etc every time through.\nOn top of that, as a full-on hobbyist programmer, writing usually just for myself, or occasionally for my family (very occasionally…) the literate programming element scratches another important itch: I tend to start things, drop them for a long time, and then come back much later, and I don't want to continue to rely on memory of how something works, and notebooks are great for this; nbdev is even better, as it can produce what I think are very pretty sites from your notebooks.\nThis all pointed me to quarto, which is the publishing system used by nbdev. And it turned out that quarto had nearly everything I wanted in a publishing system: it generates fully static sites, its sites look good (to my eyes at least) out of the box, and it makes generating pages that include the output of cells, code, etc, very easy.\n\n\nAuthoring\nI write in org, mostly. While there are times that an outline is not the right scaffolding, those times are rare, and I have come to accept, over the years, that if I can't lay out an outline of what I want to think, it may be because I haven't really thought things through.\nNotebooks are great for literate programming, but I was not willing to do pure writing in Jupyter notebooks (if I had been, I could have done this all with only nbdev, which would have made a number of things easy). Literate programming is useful when you want your code to have well-written documentation, but if there's not going to be any code, the editing capabilities of Jupyter+chrome or Jupyter+vscode, using straight markdown, are, well, pretty weak in comparison to emacs.\nI've been using GNU Emacs since 1984 or so; I know it really well, and for editing, it feels like it's built into my fingers. Especially with org mode, which makes navigation, manipulating structure, and lightweight formatting joyfully easy.\nIt helps that I'm comfortable mucking around in emacs lisp as needed to make it do what I want. Honestly, sometimes the mucking around in emacs lisp is the most fun.\n\n\nEmacs hacks\nI ended up doing some emacs hacking to make good-looking markdown files out of org files.\nMy first observation is that Org's default markdown exporter is, well, crap. You can find a number of alternatives, but I quickly discovered that pandoc does a really outstanding job, at least for the org files I've been writing. Note that I haven't yet used org tables, or the org-babel literate programming features, or dozens of other amazing features in org mode, which might be harder for pandoc to deal with.\nHowever, it turns out that by default, pandoc does not pull the #+title info from the org file to populate the markdown frontmatter, which is supposed to look like:\n---\ntitle: a document\n---\nBut, because, of course it does, pandoc has a templating system, and fixing markdown output to create properly formatted frontmatter was a matter of making a custom markdown template with a small change from default. Honestly, I'm not sure why the default behavior is not a bug, but it's easy to specify a local template.\nQuarto can run scripts before or after your site is rendered, and I'd initially thought that would run whenever an org file was updated in the content tree. But it turns out that the quarto change watcher only looks for changes to or additions of its native file types (.md, .qmd, etc). (I did find another use for pre-render scripts, which I'll share in a minute.)\nSo instead, I wrote a function that gets called whenever an org file is saved. It figures out if the org file is part of a quarto site, and if it is, it runs pandoc, using the appropriate template, to generate a markdown file. I've included it below. I'll put it up in github, perhaps in a separate repo, because others might find it useful. Some might not like that the .org \"source\" files are in the same directory as the output markdown files, but that doesn't bother me.\nThis is nice because when quarto is run locally in preview mode, it watches the site directory, and re-renders the site whenever a new markdown file is added, or an existing one is changed. Your browser just reloads with the new contant, like magic.\nNote to self: should I be worried about the public image that comes from publishing emacs lisp code? This is not a new hotness, like Rust or Typescript.\n\n\nHere's the emacs lisp code\n\n;;; below should perhaps go in a separate libary, but whatever.\n;;; an after-save-hook that uses pandoc to make a markdown version of org files after save.\n;;; It uses a template I created that preserves the title in a format that quarto likes\n(defcustom pandoc-binary \"pandoc\" \"Location of pandoc binary\"\n  :type 'string)\n\n(defcustom markdown-template (expand-file-name \"~/lib/pandoc-org-template\")\n  \"Location of custom pandoc markdown template\"\n  :type 'string)\n\n(defcustom always-convert-org-to-md nil\n  \"If non-nil, auto-markdown-after-save will convert the org file to md regardless of\nwhether or not there is a _quarto.yml file in the current directory\"\n  :type 'boolean)\n\n(defun auto-markdown-after-save ()\n  \"Use Pandoc to auto-convert an org file to markdown every time it's saved; \nSet `after-save-hook` in org mode to this value if you use quarto with org\"\n  (interactive)\n  (when (and (eq major-mode 'org-mode)\n         (or always-convert-org-to-md (file-exists-p \"_quarto.yml\")))\n    (let* ((errbuf (get-buffer-create \"*Pandoc Errors*\"))\n       (ofile (concat (file-name-sans-extension (buffer-file-name)) \".md\")))\n      (message \"converting org file to markdown...\")\n      (call-process pandoc-binary nil errbuf nil\n            \"-s\"\n            \"-o\"\n            ofile\n            (buffer-file-name))\n      (message \"converting org file to markdown...done\"))))\n\n\n\nOther bits of the authoring workflow\nI really like the left-hand-side site navigation tree that quarto displays, but it would appear that it's not generated automatically, it has to be manually created. There's a yml format for this and other site metadata.\nI wrote a prerender script (remmeber those, from a few paragraphs ago?).\n\n\nPrerender script\nDon't judge. This does not have robust error handling, and has a bunch of other sharp edges. That's OK. The author is the only customer, and he forgives himself in advance for any shortcomings.\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport os, sys\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\ntocfile = 'sidebar.yml'\nnewtocfile = tocfile + '.new'\nbackuptocfile = tocfile + '.orig'\n\ndef createtocfromdir(dir, indentlevel):\n    retval = ''\n    path = Path(dir)\n    for p in sorted(path.iterdir()):\n        if p.name[0] == '.' or p.name[0] == '_':\n            pass\n        elif p.suffix == \".md\":\n            retval += ' ' * indentlevel + '- ' + (str(p)) + '\\n'\n        elif p.is_dir():\n            retval += ' ' * indentlevel + '- section: ' + (str(p)) + '\\n'\n            retval += ' ' * (indentlevel+2) + 'contents:' + '\\n'\n            retval += createtocfromdir(p, indentlevel+2)\n        else:\n            pass\n    return retval\n\ntocbody = createtocfromdir(\".\", 6)\n\nif len(tocbody) &lt; 4:\n    print(\"exiting\")\n    sys.exit()\n\nwith open(newtocfile, \"w\") as f:\n    print(\"website:\",file=f)\n    print(\"  sidebar:\", file=f)\n    print(\"    contents:\", file=f)\n    print(createtocfromdir(\".\", 6), file=f)\n\nos.rename(tocfile, backuptocfile)\nos.rename(newtocfile, tocfile)\n\n\n\nFile order\nFile names appear in lexicographic order in the quarto table of contents, so I prefix file names with a number as a way of manually setting the ordering; right now I'm using YYYYMMDDfile.org, based on the thought that I'm trying to do something a bit bloggish, or at least chronologically sequential.\nnbdev recommends its users just use two-digit numerics as prefixes for setting file order. If I end up writing things that are more like articles than journal entries, I will try that."

The New York Film Festival is coming up, and I'll be going to a lot of it.\nRepository for updates: When I left the G, I promised to stay in touch, and I created a sign-up list that has hundreds of people on it. My thought was to send them a brief update or two, which I'll keep archived on this site. Arguably, this is just a flavor of blog, but whatever.\n\n\n\nUX\nI wanted the site to look good, on desktop and on mobile, and be fast and responsive; a static site and something simple were essential.\n\n\nSimple\nI took a hard look at hugo, but it's overkill. It clearly can do everything I would ever want, there's even native support for org mode files. But what I wanted was something with great defaults, minimal setup time, that easily let me use the authoring and scripting tools I'm comfortable with, and I didn't want to spend a zillion hours finding the right theme, learning a sophisticated templating language, that sort of thing. I may go back to hugo one day, if my needs outgrow what I'm using now; the \"stack\" (I am somwehat embarrassed to call my tech selection a stack) is simpler (well, in some sense of that word: it combines tools written in haskell, lua, deno/typescript, python, and dart, and maybe more that I haven't uncovered yet).\n\n\nCost\nI wanted to have good free hosting options. Github pages looks promising."

There are a few things that motivate me.\n\nVery flatteringly, a number of people have heard that I'm going to the New York Film Festival and they want to know what I saw and what I recommend. When I mention that I do cardio in front of the TV, and so have seen a ton of what's streaming, I get similar questions.\nAs I've had time I did not once have to think about what I've watched, I've been disappointed with the amount of thought I've put into what I've seen.\n\n\n\nWhat makes a meaningful review?\nI may be deeply unenlightened, but for me, art is something that produces an emotional reaction, and the purpose of writing about it is to memorialize and elucidate that reaction, and delve into why the viewer had that reaction.\nThat's what motivates me more than anything: a desire to record how something I experienced made me feel. There's something about the power of the memory of an emotion that reaches past the psyche and into a more primitive place, or maybe it's the child-brain we all bury. I feel (ha) that I can be more exact about what that feeling is, and where its power comes from, in the written word, and that will make for a better referral for friends or just a reminder of my own experience.\nAnd once I have those feelings down, it seems like the writing would be incomplete without going into how the work did what it did to me. Why did I feel that way? Why was it that the thing it did that made me feel that way had that effect? Why to that? And so on with the five whys.\n\"Reviews\" (if that's even the right word) are only meaningful if they start with that personal perspective.\nA friend, who went on to become a muckity-muck in the art world, but at the time was a budding journalism student, once told me that \"art is anything that makes you think.\" He loved to say outrageous things, and maybe this was one of them, but now, 30 years after he first said it to me, I am more accepting of his definition than I was at the time."
