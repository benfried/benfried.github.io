## BLUF

Is "Reporting Procedural" officially a genre? **All The President's Men**,
**Spotlight**, **The Post**; **She Said** is cut from the same cloth. It
tells the story of Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey's reporting on Harvey
Weinstein's many, many crimes against women and how they were covered up
by his enablers.

## Why should you see it?

It was gripping. Even knowing how things turned out, I couldn't help but
feel the suspense: would the reporters find someone willing to go on the
record? What would Weinstein and his people do to stop the story from
coming out? All over gain, I felt such rage at Weinstein and, even more,
at the legions of people who helped him. 82 women have gone on the
record as being victims of Weinstein. 

The cast is uniformly terrific, especially the leads. It was a trip to
see Megan Twohey on stage with Carey Mulligan, and to experience how
much Mulligan became Twohey, nailing her voice and her mannerisms.

## Notes from the screening

Even weeks after seeing the movie, I kept coming back to all those
helpers: lawyers, PR people, payers of hush money, they're accomplices
or worse. How many women might have been saved if Weinstein hadn't had
the protection of so many lawyers, publicists, helpers. There is a
terrible truth about our system and how it can be perfectly legal and
ethical to be in the business of protecting the powerful from justice.
