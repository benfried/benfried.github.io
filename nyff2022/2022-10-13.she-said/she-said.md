## BLUF

See it. The story of Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey's exposing of Harvey
Weinstein's many, many crimes against women and how they were covered up
by his enablers. It was gripping. Even knowing how things turned out,
I couldn't help but feel the suspense: would the reporters find someone
willing to go on the record? What would Weinstein and his people do to
stop the story from coming out?

The cast is terrific. It was a trip to see Megan Twohey on stage with
Carey Mulligan, and to experience how much Mulligan did to become
Twohey, to nail her voice and her physicality.
