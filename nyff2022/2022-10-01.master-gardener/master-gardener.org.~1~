** Master Gardener

I liked it. Should you see it? Probably.

Great peformance by Edgerton. Something about him reminded me of Bryan
Cranston. Over time you see the capacity for violance that's just below
the surface.

Sigourney Weaver is fantastic.

*Spoiler ---*

At the end, you could see all the signs that pointed to her being the
real racist.

The journal of the lonely outcast trope is used here, which Schrader
borrows from himself in /Taxi Driver/. Roth is no Travis Bickle, but the
use of the journal entry as narrative, and the climax features the hero
charging into a lair of scummy people to save the girl in a way that
seemed more than a bit like Schrader repeating himself.
