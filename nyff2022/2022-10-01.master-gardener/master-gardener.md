## BLUF

I liked it. I don\'t regret having seen it. Should you see it? Probably.
Interesting plot and characters, and some great acting.

## Plot

Edgerton plays the lead horticulturalist at the family estate of
Weaver\'s character. He\'s a loner, completely dedicated to gardening.
Weaver asks him to take on her great-niece as an apprentice. This sends
the plot into gear, and we learn that there\'s more to Edgerton\'s
character

Great peformance by Edgerton. Something about him reminded me of Bryan
Cranston. He\'s a man with a past, on a path of redemption.

Sigourney Weaver is fantastic.

The narration from the journal of the lonely protagonist trope is used
here, which Schrader borrows from himself in *Taxi Driver*. Roth is no
Travis Bickle, but the use of the journal entry as narrative, and the
climax features the hero charging into a lair of scummy people to save
the girl in a way that seemed more than a bit like Schrader repeating
himself.
