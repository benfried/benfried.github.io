** BLUF

Emmett Till's story is an outrage, a shame, a traged, one of many from
our long dark history of racism. Emmett's mother, Mamie Till Mobley, is a
hero who fought for justice for her son, and to make sure that his story
was told.

The movie has some tremendous performances, especially Danielle
Deadwyler's. However it came off in places as painfully didactic. A
worthy subject, but the script does not live up to the material nor to
the talents of the cast.

** Plot

Emmett Till was a 14-year-old African-American boy from Chicago, who
went to Mississippi to visit his cousins. While there he was abducted,
tortured, and lynched. 

The movie is largely Mamie's story, though it follows Emmett until he's
murdered. The opening scene is a masterful moment for Deadwyler, as we
see that a happy sing-a-long she's sharing with Emmett masks her fear
for his safety in his upcoming trip to visit his cousins in Money,
Mississippi.

The movie builds dread effectively; Mamie's fear for Emmett while he's
traveling, and every scene of Emmett's in Money build 

Mamie fights for justice for Emmett, using her connections to get his
body brought to Chicago, insisting on an open casket, testifying at the
trial of his murderers, and fighting for anti-lynching laws.

** Thoughts

Powerful material and great performances, but the stilted lecturing of
the dialogue left me thinking I'd have rather spent that time reading
about Mamie and Emmett.
