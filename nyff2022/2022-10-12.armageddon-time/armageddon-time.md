## BLUF

This is writer/director James Gray's biopic. It takes place in the Fall
of 1980, when he was in sixth grade. With the election of Ronald Reagan
in the background, it's a story about innocence lost, for Paul, the
protagonist, as well as for America, about fitting in versus doing the
right thing, about taking accountability.

That sounds heavy and moralistic, but it's not. The story is so
personal, and the performances so true, that it never feels didactic or
preachy. The actors are excellent: you might think that the big stars
would overrun something so intimate, but they don't. (There *is* a
delightful cameo by Jessica Chastain that heads a little in that
territory).

## Why should you see it?

I could boil it down and truthfully say that it's a coming of age story,
set in a time and place of great interest, with great performances. We
see differences in race and class take two similar boys down two
very different paths. But more importantly, I think, what makes it stand
out is that every character is real: no one is all good or bad, almost
everyone has good moments and not so good moments. There is so much
understanding, so much texture.

A number of Gray's movies (**Little Odessa**, **The Lost City of Z**)
have been on my "watch one day" list, but the only film of his I'd seen
was **Ad Astra**. **Ad Astra** felt contemplative, deliberate, and, in
my recollection, was an exercise in creating a sense of emotional
isolation in the audience, mirroring Brad Pitt's character's, in turn a
reflection of the loneliness, emptiness, and silence of space.

Although both movies examine troubled father-son relationships,
**Armageddon Time** could not be more different. It is full of warmth;
it has empathy and compassion for complicated, flawed people. It wants
its audience to understand the mix of good and and bad in its
characters.

I love movies that make me feel entertained. But, most entertainments
leave an echo of adrenaline and little more. **Armageddon Time**
made me feel like I had understood its characters, and that I had an
emotional understanding of people, a moment in time, parts of a life.
There's something sort of magic about that.

## Notes from the screening

Gray spoke about how he saw 1980 as a pivotal moment: Reagan's election
was a turn for America, towards greed, hatred, a darkness that we
continue to live in. At the same time, many momentous things happened to
him and his family; his comments helped me better understand it all (and
the added significance of the title and the use of The Clash's
*Armagideon Time* in the closing credits.

Jeremy Strong's technique and preparation get a lot of attention, and
there was a question asked about that; he did spend time with Gray's
father (or perhaps with videos of Gray's father? I don't have notes) and
spoke a bit about the preparation helping him to be a "vessel".
