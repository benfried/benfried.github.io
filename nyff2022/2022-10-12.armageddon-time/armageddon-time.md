Yes, see this, too. This is a biopic, from the life of director James
Gray, covering part of his sixth grade year, in the fall of 1980. It's
the end of an era, and the beginning of a much darker period, and also a
touching story of a boy and his family, and kind of a meditation on
accountability, and fitting in versus doing the right thing.
