** White Noise


*** Color palette - bright colors in super market

*** Adam Driver looking older - belly / low pants, chin tucked agains neck

*** amazing closing credits sequence / choreography

*** few strong set pieces that are like tent poles
**** dinner after the toxic spill (?)
**** joint lecture on Elvis & Hitler with Cheadle
**** Closing scenes in motel & hospital

*** Denial about toxic spill

*** Stiltedness of much of the dialogue
Meant to be caricature of hyper-literate academics, hiding behind their vocabulary?

*** The "white noise" --- people talking over each other
Reminded me a little of Altman, but the effect on me is much more one of
confusion. I thought this was a good touch, and it reminded me of my own
dinner table, five people seeming having six different conversations,
and it overwhelms me and I can't understand any of it.
