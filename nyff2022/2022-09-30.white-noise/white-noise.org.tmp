** BLUF

See it. It's not really like anything else. Excellent performances. Many
striking, unforgettable scenes. The closing credits alone are almost
worth the price of admission. My one quibble is that the dialogue feels
stilted and artificial at times, particularly at the beginning. Maybe it
got better or maybe I adjusted.

** Disorganized Notes


*** Color palette - bright colors in super market

*** Adam Driver looking older - belly / low pants, chin tucked agains neck

*** amazing closing credits sequence / choreography

*** few strong set pieces that are like tent poles
**** dinner after the toxic spill (?)
**** joint lecture on Elvis & Hitler with Cheadle
**** Closing scenes in motel & hospital

*** Denial about toxic spill

*** Stiltedness of much of the dialogue
Meant to be caricature of hyper-literate academics, hiding behind their vocabulary?

*** The "white noise" --- people talking over each other
Reminded me a little of Altman, but the effect on me is much more one of
confusion. I thought this was a good touch, and it reminded me of my own
dinner table, five people seeming having six different conversations,
and it overwhelms me and I can't understand any of it.
