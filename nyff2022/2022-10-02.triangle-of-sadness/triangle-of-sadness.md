## BLUF

An absurdist satire about a cruise on a super-yacht. It goes over the
top in a way reminiscent of Peter Greenaway (there\'s a lot of vomit).
It\'s an allegory about class, wealth, money, power, and beauty. It
could have used a better editor: it\'s 2:30, and there\'s 30-45 minutes
of material that would not be missed. Woody Harrelson steals the show as
the Marxist captain of the yacht.

Should you see it? Well, if the paragraph above excites you, yes. If you
like the movies of Peter Greenaway, yes. If that description doesn\'t do
much for you, if *The Cook, The Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover* is
something you\'d rather forget, skip it.
