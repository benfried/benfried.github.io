** BLUF

An absurdist satire about a cruise on a super-yacht. A qualified
recommendation. 

It goes over the top in a way reminiscent of Peter Greenaway (there's a
lot of vomit). It's an allegory about class, wealth, money, power, and
beauty. It is needlessly long: 2:30, and 30-45 minutes of it would not
be missed. Woody Harrelson steals the show as the Marxist yacht captain.

Should you see it? Well, if the paragraph above excites you, yes. If you
like the movies of Peter Greenaway, yes. If you travel in circles where
the social commentary it makes will be important, possibly. If my
description doesn't do much for you, if /The Cook, The Thief, His Wife,
and Her Lover/ is something you'd rather forget, skip it.
