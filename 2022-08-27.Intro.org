#+title: Introduction

*** Purpose

There are a few things I'm looking to accomplish with this site.

1. Be a kind of lab notebook, where I can store my notes, project ideas,
   instructions to self, etc.

2. Something blog-ish: I want to, for example, write down what I think
   about movies and TV shows I watch. The [[https://www.filmlinc.org/nyff2022/][New York Film Festival]] is coming
   up, and I'll be going to a lot of it.

3. Repository for updates: When I left the G, I promised to stay in
   touch, and I created a sign-up list that has hundreds of people on
   it. My thought was to send them a brief update or two, which I'll
   keep archived on this site. Arguably, this is just a flavor of blog,
   but whatever.

*** UX 

I wanted the site to look good, on desktop and on mobile, and be fast
and responsive; a static site and something simple were essential.

*** Simple

I took a hard look at [[https://gohugo.io][hugo]], but it's overkill. It clearly can do
everything I would ever want, there's even native support for org mode
files. But what I wanted was something with great defaults, minimal
setup time, that easily let me use the authoring and scripting tools I'm
comfortable with, and I didn't want to spend a zillion hours finding the
right theme, learning a sophisticated templating language, that sort of
thing. I may go back to hugo one day, if my needs outgrow what I'm using
now; the "stack" (I am somwehat embarrassed to call my tech selection a
stack) is simpler (well, in some sense of that word: it combines tools
written in haskell, lua, deno/typescript, python, and dart, and maybe
more that I haven't uncovered yet).

*** Cost

I wanted to have good free hosting options. Github pages looks
promising.
