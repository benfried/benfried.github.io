    "section": "The reason people disagree with one another",
    "text": "The reason people disagree with one another\nis as obvious as it is simple. Our beliefs emotions, desires and intentions do not perfectly align with everyone else. And the self-serving bias, in which we tend to perceive ourselves in an overly favorable manner, when coupled to the confirmation bias, in which we tend to find confirming evidence for our beliefs, makes it almost inevitable that when disagreements arise with others, we will think we are right and they are wrong. Therefore, to better communicate through disagreement, the first thing I want you to do is to override the self-serving bias and the confirmation bias through these steps. First, realize that the other person is also subject to those same biases. And so they're as convinced as you are that they're right and you're wrong. Next, say to yourself, \"What if I'm wrong and the other person is right?\" What this really means is that you should consider the possibility that the disagreement you're experiencing is not obvious because you're right and the other person is wrong. It could be the opposite. Now, I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm only saying that it's possible you could be and the realization of that possibility opens the door just a little to find agreement. Another great step is to ask yourself, \"What's the goal of this conversation? What am I trying to accomplish? What do I hope to get out of it?\" By clarifying this to yourself, you can figure out how important it is to find agreement in the conversation, or walk away, or even concede that the other person is right. An important point is that you should not try to win the conversation. If you treat it as a competition, a win-lose game, then a conversation must, by definition, have a winner and a loser, and no one wants to be a loser, so any chance of finding agreement will be lost. Next, I want you to think of a conversation as a cooperative task in which both sides win, a win-win game. That way your conversation partner will feel like, well, a partner, someone who expects to get as much out of the conversation as you do. And finally, to better communicate through disagreement, look to change the purpose of the conversation from winning to understanding. You want to understand the position of your partner. What does she want? What is he thinking? Where is she coming from? If you can incorporate these tools into your conversational toolkit, congratulations, you've already overcome the most fundamental obstacle that leads most conversations to disintegrate into disagreement. And these tools do something else. They help you build new and better relationships, which is the key to business, friendship, marriage, and society. In my work as a public intellectual, I often do public debates. I've actually been doing them for over a quarter century now. I've engaged hundreds, if not thousands of people with whom I disagree. You could say it's my job, but let me tell you about the hardest thing I've ever done, which is understanding what the other person really thinks. This is so important because we can't get inside other people's minds. The only way we can know what they're thinking is through communication. Words are all we have. So it's incredibly important to try to get the other person to state as clearly as they can, what it is they believe on the topic you're discussing. One reason this is so hard is because a lot of times people don't know exactly what it is they believe. They might be lying. They may be self deceived. They could be confused. Their beliefs and feelings may be subconscious. Pollsters know that what people tell them about, say what candidate they like in an upcoming election or what their beliefs are or what food preferences they have. What people actually do say how they voted in an election, which house of worship they attend, or what supermarket they shop at does not always match what they say. Then there's the problem of you trying to guess what they're thinking or anticipate it from past experience, or imagine it by putting yourself into their mind. But I can tell you from experience that this is a recipe for failure. To get around this problem, you need to state in your own words, what it is you think the other person believes, or what they're thinking or what their position is on a topic you're discussing. What usually happens when people do this is they restate the other person's position in a way that's easy to refute or to counter or to rebut. This is often known as the straw man approach, where someone creates a version of the other person's beliefs that is so light and fragile, it can be easily knocked down. When you straw man someone's beliefs, you've done them a disservice and they will resent it. So in order to communicate the disagreement, here's what I want you to do. Steel man. Steel Manning is a new term for an old idea. It was first developed by a mathematical psychologist named Anatol Rapoport. He studied game theory and the mathematical modeling of social interaction, especially conflicts between people and nations. What he discovered was that people are often talking past each other because they really were not understanding the other person's position. So when you steel man another person's position, you restate their beliefs again and again, until you've come to an agreement on what it is you're talking about. And if you do this right, it will result in them saying something like, yes, that's exactly what I believe, well said. So your goal here is to aim for that's right. And through this, we gain agreement through more effective communication."

    "text": "Skills for good communication\nIn the process of studying human conflict, mathematical psychologist Anatol Rapoport developed rules for communication that have come to be known as Rapoport's rules. The key one being restating the other person's position so clearly that they acknowledge that this is indeed precisely what they believe. I almost never succeed at doing this the first time. But it almost always leads the other person to clarify or correct my statement such that eventually I get it right. Here are some other tips I recommend that I've learned over the years. First, be respectful of the other person. No one likes to be disrespected. Next, you want to listen attentively. Most people don't listen, they wait for the other person to stop talking, so they can jump back in with their own statement. Then, aim to find points of agreement and state them so that the other person doesn't feel like the conversation is a life or death struggle with no hope for progress. Find something you've learned from the other person and then state it out loud. Acknowledge that you understand why someone might hold that opinion. Keep emotions out of the exchange. And finally, discuss, don't attack. Nothing will end a conversation faster than attacking someone. They'll put up their defenses and at that point, the conversation is over. These tools of good communication through disagreement may not always work to change people's minds, but they may reduce unnecessary divisiveness so rampant in our lives."

    "section": "Active listening",
    "text": "Active listening\nIn conversations, most of us want to do most of the talking. That creates an obvious problem, if both parties in the conversation want to talk at the same time. And it's especially vexing for communicating through disagreement. When this happens, most of us are not listening to the other person. We're just waiting for them to stop talking so we can talk, politely nodding and pretending to listen, when we're actually formulating what we want to say next. You may think you're hiding your inner voice but people can read body language and your communication partner will be able to tell that you're not actually listening to them. Just as I'm sure you've had the experience of knowing someone wasn't really listening to what you're saying. This is not conducive for communications, so here's what I want you to do. First, listen. And this is very hard to do, I know from experience, but I mean really listen. What is often called active listening. Next, I want you to fully concentrate on what the other person is saying. Maybe even repeating silently to yourself what it is they're trying to tell you. Then you should reflect back what the person is saying by mirroring it. Simply repeat, in your own words, what the person just told you. You also want to empathize with the person by making it clear through your listening, that you're really hearing them, and feel why they may feel that way. Aim to comprehend what the person is telling you. Comprehending means trying to grasp the central point that they're making, and communicating to them that you fully comprehend what it is they're saying. Finally, you want to retain what they told you throughout the conversation, even if you disagree with them. So if you adopt these six tools into your conversation, you'll gain the respect and trust of the other person. Even if that isn't your goal, it's a necessary strategy for communicating through disagreement, because that's the only way to get them to listen to you. For me to get you to listen to me, I must be willing to listen to you. If I want you to trust and respect me, I have to be willing to trust and respect you. This is the basis of all trust in human relations. An absolutely central ingredient for clear communications."

    "text": "Asking questions\nOne of my favorite television shows in the 1970s was Columbo, a crime drama staring Peter Fock as a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department who famously figured out who done it by asking lots of questions. In his rumpled beige rain coat and unassuming demeanor, his catch phrase was just one more thing followed by penetrating questions of the suspect that led to self-incriminating statements or an outright confession of the suspects. His questions began innocently enough. For example he would touch the suspects lapel and say hey, is this cashmere. The questions would build from there circling around the crime in question. A disarming device along the lines of I'm just asking questions. Now this is just a fun example. I don't want you to treat your conversation partner as a crime suspect. The point is that asking the right questions can get the other person to make your point for you to confess if you will that you're right. So here are some general questions I want you to ask in your conversations. What is it exactly you believe? Or what precisely is your position? Please clarify it for me because I want to understand. How did you arrive at that belief or position? Did you always believe that or is this a new position that you hold? What is the source for your belief? Is it a reliable source? Are you sure? What if this source for your belief or position turned out to be unreliable or even wrong? Would you change your mind? What would it take to change your mind? This final point is crucial. Very few of us change our minds, especially on issues and beliefs that are important to our core self. The way we define ourselves. Before you ask that last question I want you to determine if the belief the person holds is so important to the core of their being that they'll probably never change their model. If you determine that in fact, the point of the conversation does not involve one of these core beliefs, then there's a chance the person will consider changing their mind. So clarifying precisely what it would take to get them to change their mind is vital to communicating through disagreement. Here I want you to probe a little deeper on the question what would it take to change your mind. For example you might try asking would you change your mind if you knew that the source of your position is wrong? Would you change your mind if the facts changed? Please can you tell me what precisely it would take to change your mind? These tools are especially important for finding common ground, and this is important. You have to be willing to reciprocate. That is I want you to tell the other person that you're willing to change your mind if the facts change even if you don't believe it at the time."

    "text": "The power of yes\nThere is one surefire way to create disagreement in communication. And that is to interject the word, but into the conversation, no matter what the other person says, if you respond, Yes, but, it signals that you're about to provide a counterexample to rebut the person's argument or statement. Here's an example. If I say, I think the best way to increase sales is to cancel our print advertising and switch to social media advertising. And you respond: - [Young Man] Yes, but sometimes print advertising really works and social media can be so uncertain. - Here, the yes, but clause counters my point and signals that the other person might disagree with me. Now, maybe they do, and maybe that's okay sometimes. But here's what I'd like you to try. Instead of yes, but, say, yes, and. For example, if I say, I think the best way to structure the project team is with a member from each product line so no one feels left out, and you say: - [Young Man] Yes, and if we're going to go by product line, we should explore which product lines are the must haves for the special team. - This idea comes from the Harvard negotiation project. They call it the and stance by linking points in a conversation with the word and instead of but, you recognize your conversation partner's points without conceding any of your own. It also signals that you want to work with your conversation partner instead of against them. Finally, it recognizes that both people in the conversation may have valid points, even if it appears that the ideas are in disagreement. Now, to bring this to life, I want to provide some examples that can help you navigate trickier topics that can potentially drive people apart. Compare this sentence. Yes, but how should we deal with the cancellation of that product line? To this sentence: - [Young Man] Yes, and how should we deal with the cancellation of that product line? - If you don't begin with yes, you can eliminate but by switching to and. For example, compare, that's a great idea, but what about all the users who will be adversely affected? To: - [Young Man] That's a great idea. And what about all the users who will be adversely affected? - If you completely disagree and do not want to begin with yes, then use the word interesting and follow that with and. For example, interesting, and what about the lost revenue on all those recalled products? Or: - [Young Man] Interesting. And how should we deal with the lost revenue on those recalled products? - I've tried switching from but to and myself. It's difficult to do at first, because interjecting but into our conversations comes so naturally out of habit. Like other habits, this one can be curbed with practice. So I'd like you to go out and consciously try it until it comes unconsciously."

    "text": "Dealing with strong emotions\nAmong the myriad of human emotions anger, resentment, and even hatred are arguably the most dangerous, because they can so readily lead to massive disagreement in communication. Sometimes they are the result of disagreement. Either way, we need to learn how to deal with these feelings, because if we don't and disagreement leads to anger, or vice versa, the conversation is over. One of my personal heroes is Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who practiced nonviolent resistance to the Jim Crow laws that he and much of the African American community experienced in the mid 20th century, when the civil rights movement picked up momentum. Dr. King and his people encountered such blatant racism that few of us would reproach them for expressing anger, even hatred, at those who called them racial epithets, spat on them on the street, beat them behind buildings, and other unspeakable things. But Dr. King realized that as he told an audience at a 1958 speech, \"Hate begets hate, violence, begets violence, \"toughness begets greater toughness. \"We must meet the forces of hate with the power of love.\" And again, in a 1963 speech, \"Darkness cannot drive out darkness, \"only light can do that. \"Hate cannot drive out hate, \"only love can do that. \"Hate multiplies hate, violence multiplies violence, \"and toughness multiplies toughness \"in a descending spiral of destruction.\" When conversations spiral into disagreement and people's emotions begin to rise anger is not far behind. And where anger lurks hatred is not far behind. I've been guilty of this myself and I'll bet you have as well. So here's what I'd like you to do when you feel anger coming on during a conversation. First, monitor your emotions. Ask yourself, do I just disagree with this person? Or am I actually becoming angry with them? Then focus on the argument the person is making, not on what might seem like their intention to make you angry. Take a moment to deescalate your emotions by focusing purely on the ideas being discussed instead of the person discussing them. Try to be silent and let the other person talk while your emotional temperature comes down. It's always a good idea to take a break. If things are heating up so much that you don't think you can deescalate your emotions, walk away for a few minutes. You can simply excuse yourself for a bathroom break, go outside for some fresh air. You could even be honest and say, I'm getting really angry at the moment, so I'm going to take a break for five minutes. Finally, you can always exit entirely if none of the other tools work and you feel like you're losing control of your emotions, leave. You can just say something like, let's continue this conversation another day, or I'm done with this conversation, and then just turn and walk away. Remember these tools and use them the next time you find yourself feeling strong emotions."

    "text": "Refractory period\nPsychologists who study anger have discovered what they call a refractory period. A period of time in which your nervous system is so ramped up, that it takes some time to return to normal. This could be anywhere from five minutes to five hours to five days or longer, depending on how angry you are and what it is you're angry about. This is where the old advice of counting to 10 comes from. That's a refractory period, after which ,hopefully, your anger subsides. And we're beginning to see these cooling off periods more and more. In the courts, for example, divorces now have a cooling off period. And now ever since the financial meltdown of 2009, due to the mortgage crisis, large loans now have a cooling off period. The consequences of not controlling your emotions are significant. As Groucho Marx once remarked, \"Speak when you're angry \"and you'll make the best speech you'll ever regret.\" If the anger is on the other side, that is, if you're keeping your cool and your conversation partner's getting angry, I want you to do something about that as well, because their anger is just as bad as yours for disagreement. If you detect this in your partner, here's what I'd like you to do. First, look for signs of frustration, offense, or anger in the face and voice of your partner. Next, try to deescalate your partner's anger by offering them a refractory period. Maybe suggest taking a short break. You also want to acknowledge that you understand why they're getting upset, and ask if there's anything you said or did to anger them. The question alone will likely diffuse their emotions. It's important to try to reframe the argument or rephrase what you said that made them angry. A critical step is to listen, listen, and then listen some more. Do not escalate by talking more. Find some points of agreement with your partner. Something positive to say about them or their ideas. But don't sound condescending. It's important that you don't blame. Assume the best in your partner, and tell them that. Best intentions should be the default. Apologize if needed. And finally, exit, leave, walk away if necessary. As Dr. King said in his now canonized, I Have a Dream speech, \"In the process of gaining our rightful place, \"we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. \"Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom \"by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. \"We must forever conduct our struggle \"on the high plane of dignity and discipline.\" So I want you to aspire to the lofty plane of Dr. King's life of dignity and discipline."

    "text": "What would it take to change your mind?\nIn my experience, one of the best questions I've ever asked someone with whom I disagreed with is what would it take to change your mind? That question is at the very heart of the entire scientific method. It's what the philosopher of science, Karl Popper called falsification, that is Popper showed that in science, it's not possible to definitively prove true some claim because there's always the possibility that the next experiment or observation will uncover a counterexample that disproves your claim. So for example, if I say all swans are white, I can provide you with ten or even a thousand pictures of white swans from around the world. But that doesn't prove that all swans are white because there may be some corner of the world where swans are black. And sure enough, in Australia, there's black swans. And when they were discovered, it served as an example of the falsification of the theory that all swans are white. So the key to science is not proving hypothesis to be true, but trying to falsify them with counterexamples, you know, like black swans. So if your theory has not been falsified, despite many attempts to falsify it, then we can be confident that it might be true even while admitting that we haven't proven it to be true. So all scientific theories are at best provisionally true. While we always entertain the possibility that the next experiment or observation may modify it or falsify it. Thus, the key to communicating through disagreement is to establish what it would take to falsify the belief of the other person in the conversation, as well as what it would take to falsify your own belief. If you ask your conversation partner, what would it take to change your mind? And your partner says nothing will ever change my mind. Then the conversation is over. What's the point of talking in order to resolve disagreements, if the other person says, no matter what you say, they won't change their mind, but the same applies to you. If you cannot think of what it would take to change your mind, then there's no point in the other person talking to you. For this lesson, I want you to ask that question or some variation of it in future conversations with people who you disagree with on some topic, and then think of your own answer to the question of what it would take to change your mind. Because if you offer your falsification criteria, then you stand a better chance of the other person offering their own falsification criteria. Then the two of you can find a way to resolve your disagreements."

    "text": "Learning from hostage negotiators\nThere are a group of experts who are professionals at communicating through disagreement and these are hostage negotiators. These are conversations held at the highest levels of emotional trauma, when people's lives are at stake, both the hostages' and the hostage taker, and the negotiator must somehow diffuse the tensions and negotiate with the hostage taker to change their mind. This, you can imagine, is not easy to do, but how they do it provides lessons I want you to adopt in your own conversation, even if they are never as dramatic as a hostage negotiation situation. Here are some of the tools used by hostage negotiators. The first is to use minimal encouragers. Words like yeah, I see, and okay. Minimal encouragers are an effortless way to let your conversation partner know that you're listening. Another tool is mirroring or reflecting what you think the other person is saying. You can do this by repeating the last few words of what someone said. For example, if someone says, \"I'm just so sick \"and tired of these people pushing everyone around \"and trying to get their way,\" you can say, \"Get their way?\" Or consider this example. A trapped armed robber in a bank might say, - [Robber] I have to get out of here with the money. It's for my kid. It's not for me. - [Instructor] A good mirroring response would be, \"For your kid?\" To which the robber might say. - [Robber] Yeah, he's got a fever and an infection. We don't have the money for the medicine he's supposed to take. He needs the money for the medicine. - Here's an example of a poor mirroring response. You expect me to believe that it's not for you? You can generally avoid such mistakes by repeating only the last two or three words, phrasing them as questions and then letting the person talk while you listen. The goal of this application is to keep the person talking and volunteering more and more information that may become useful later in the conversation. Another tool is emotional labeling. When you emotionally label someone's feeling, you give it a name. This is similar to helping someone vent but more emphasis is placed on you labeling someone's feelings as opposed to coming up with a description together. Here's any example. A subject who is angry about a breakup says. - [Man] Nobody should get away with hurting other people this way. They're going to know what it's like. - A negotiator suggests that a good reply, using emotional labeling would be you sound pretty hurt about being left. It doesn't seem fair. This response, they explain, recognizes feelings without judging them. So these are a few tools that are used by top hostage negotiators. They can go a long way to helping you improve your communication."

    "text": "Excel with hostage negotiation tips\nThere are a few other methods from the world of hostage negotiation that can help you more clearly communicate and break through disagreement. The first is allow the person to save face. That is, build a golden bridge. This is more something to be aware of as opposed to a specific technique. People are less likely to change their minds, particularly in front of those they view as important, if they think they'll lose face; consequently, you should consider ways to allow your conversation partner to save face gracefully. This may include stating how difficult it was for you to change your mind about the issue or saying something like, \"This is just such a difficult and complicated problem. \"It's just so easy not to get it exactly correct.\" Another helpful tip is to deal with small issues first. Try to create a climate of success by dealing with and resolving small issues first then, in the words of hostage negotiators, break down the big problems into a number of smaller problems that are each easier to handle. For example, let's say the boss says, \"Team, we need to double our sales by the end of the year.\" This is just too large a problem to even begin solving. A better way is to break this down by figuring out what you can do this quarter, then this month, then this week, and even today or in the next few days to increase sales. Now I know it sounds extreme to suggest that you act like a hostage negotiator and treat your conversation partner as if they were some criminal holding people hostage. No, what I want you to take away from this lesson is that there are tried and true techniques used in the most extreme conditions that work to communicate through disagreement."

    "text": "Tools for effective communication\nBefore we go, a few more things to keep in mind. Be sure to ask a lot of questions so that your conversation partner tells you even more about what they think. So that they know that you are listening and respecting them. But more importantly, so that you learn something new and grow from the conversation. Also, ask the other person what it would take for them to change their mind. Then I want you to ask yourself what it would take for you to change your mind. One of the most important things you can do to communicate through disagreement is to set up ground rules on what would settle the disagreement. Some logical flaw or factual observation that contradicts their or your position could settle the issue once and for all. Often people hold beliefs for the wrong reasons. If you can establish what those reasons are and how they can be tested or checked, you might be able to settle the disagreement factually. Always keep your emotions in check. Anger begets anger. Hatred begets hatred. Emotions will cloud your thinking and only trigger the other person to respond to your emotion with emotions of their own. I want you to monitor your emotions and the moment you sense they're building up, take a break. Count to ten. Or simply excuse yourself and walk away. Practice mirroring. I would like you to try to mirror what the other person is saying by simply repeating part of what they said back to them. A word or a clause or a sentence. Just repeat back to them what they said and end it with a question mark, a rise in your voice at the end of the sentence, like you're asking them to elaborate, which is what you want them to do so that you better understand what they're saying. And so that they feel like you're really listening to them. And finally, give your conversation partner the benefit of the doubt by practicing the principle of best intentions. That is, assuming the person you're talking to has good intentions, even if you think that they don't. If they don't, that will come out in time anyway. But if they do, and most people do have good intentions, then you will have aired on the side of being respectful. They will feel like you trust them and are really listening and both of you will feel better about taking the time and investing the energy into having a meaningful conversation."

    "title": "my org file",
    "section": "The reason people disagree with one another",
    "text": "The reason people disagree with one another\nis as obvious as it is simple. Our beliefs emotions, desires and intentions do not perfectly align with everyone else. And the self-serving bias, in which we tend to perceive ourselves in an overly favorable manner, when coupled to the confirmation bias, in which we tend to find confirming evidence for our beliefs, makes it almost inevitable that when disagreements arise with others, we will think we are right and they are wrong. Therefore, to better communicate through disagreement, the first thing I want you to do is to override the self-serving bias and the confirmation bias through these steps. First, realize that the other person is also subject to those same biases. And so they're as convinced as you are that they're right and you're wrong. Next, say to yourself, \"What if I'm wrong and the other person is right?\" What this really means is that you should consider the possibility that the disagreement you're experiencing is not obvious because you're right and the other person is wrong. It could be the opposite. Now, I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm only saying that it's possible you could be and the realization of that possibility opens the door just a little to find agreement. Another great step is to ask yourself, \"What's the goal of this conversation? What am I trying to accomplish? What do I hope to get out of it?\" By clarifying this to yourself, you can figure out how important it is to find agreement in the conversation, or walk away, or even concede that the other person is right. An important point is that you should not try to win the conversation. If you treat it as a competition, a win-lose game, then a conversation must, by definition, have a winner and a loser, and no one wants to be a loser, so any chance of finding agreement will be lost. Next, I want you to think of a conversation as a cooperative task in which both sides win, a win-win game. That way your conversation partner will feel like, well, a partner, someone who expects to get as much out of the conversation as you do. And finally, to better communicate through disagreement, look to change the purpose of the conversation from winning to understanding. You want to understand the position of your partner. What does she want? What is he thinking? Where is she coming from? If you can incorporate these tools into your conversational toolkit, congratulations, you've already overcome the most fundamental obstacle that leads most conversations to disintegrate into disagreement. And these tools do something else. They help you build new and better relationships, which is the key to business, friendship, marriage, and society. In my work as a public intellectual, I often do public debates. I've actually been doing them for over a quarter century now. I've engaged hundreds, if not thousands of people with whom I disagree. You could say it's my job, but let me tell you about the hardest thing I've ever done, which is understanding what the other person really thinks. This is so important because we can't get inside other people's minds. The only way we can know what they're thinking is through communication. Words are all we have. So it's incredibly important to try to get the other person to state as clearly as they can, what it is they believe on the topic you're discussing. One reason this is so hard is because a lot of times people don't know exactly what it is they believe. They might be lying. They may be self deceived. They could be confused. Their beliefs and feelings may be subconscious. Pollsters know that what people tell them about, say what candidate they like in an upcoming election or what their beliefs are or what food preferences they have. What people actually do say how they voted in an election, which house of worship they attend, or what supermarket they shop at does not always match what they say. Then there's the problem of you trying to guess what they're thinking or anticipate it from past experience, or imagine it by putting yourself into their mind. But I can tell you from experience that this is a recipe for failure. To get around this problem, you need to state in your own words, what it is you think the other person believes, or what they're thinking or what their position is on a topic you're discussing. What usually happens when people do this is they restate the other person's position in a way that's easy to refute or to counter or to rebut. This is often known as the straw man approach, where someone creates a version of the other person's beliefs that is so light and fragile, it can be easily knocked down. When you straw man someone's beliefs, you've done them a disservice and they will resent it. So in order to communicate the disagreement, here's what I want you to do. Steel man. Steel Manning is a new term for an old idea. It was first developed by a mathematical psychologist named Anatol Rapoport. He studied game theory and the mathematical modeling of social interaction, especially conflicts between people and nations. What he discovered was that people are often talking past each other because they really were not understanding the other person's position. So when you steel man another person's position, you restate their beliefs again and again, until you've come to an agreement on what it is you're talking about. And if you do this right, it will result in them saying something like, yes, that's exactly what I believe, well said. So your goal here is to aim for that's right. And through this, we gain agreement through more effective communication."

    "text": "Active listening\nIn conversations, most of us want to do most of the talking. That creates an obvious problem, if both parties in the conversation want to talk at the same time. And it's especially vexing for communicating through disagreement. When this happens, most of us are not listening to the other person. We're just waiting for them to stop talking so we can talk, politely nodding and pretending to listen, when we're actually formulating what we want to say next. You may think you're hiding your inner voice but people can read body language and your communication partner will be able to tell that you're not actually listening to them. Just as I'm sure you've had the experience of knowing someone wasn't really listening to what you're saying. This is not conducive for communications, so here's what I want you to do. First, listen. And this is very hard to do, I know from experience, but I mean really listen. What is often called active listening. Next, I want you to fully concentrate on what the other person is saying. Maybe even repeating silently to yourself what it is they're trying to tell you. Then you should reflect back what the person is saying by mirroring it. Simply repeat, in your own words, what the person just told you. You also want to empathize with the person by making it clear through your listening, that you're really hearing them, and feel why they may feel that way. Aim to comprehend what the person is telling you. Comprehending means trying to grasp the central point that they're making, and communicating to them that you fully comprehend what it is they're saying. Finally, you want to retain what they told you throughout the conversation, even if you disagree with them. So if you adopt these six tools into your conversation, you'll gain the respect and trust of the other person. Even if that isn't your goal, it's a necessary strategy for communicating through disagreement, because that's the only way to get them to listen to you. For me to get you to listen to me, I must be willing to listen to you. If I want you to trust and respect me, I have to be willing to trust and respect you. This is the basis of all trust in human relations. An absolutely central ingredient for clear communications."

    "text": "Asking questions\nOne of my favorite television shows in the 1970s was Columbo, a crime drama staring Peter Fock as a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department who famously figured out who done it by asking lots of questions. In his rumpled beige rain coat and unassuming demeanor, his catch phrase was just one more thing followed by penetrating questions of the suspect that led to self-incriminating statements or an outright confession of the suspects. His questions began innocently enough. For example he would touch the suspects lapel and say hey, is this cashmere. The questions would build from there circling around the crime in question. A disarming device along the lines of I'm just asking questions. Now this is just a fun example. I don't want you to treat your conversation partner as a crime suspect. The point is that asking the right questions can get the other person to make your point for you to confess if you will that you're right. So here are some general questions I want you to ask in your conversations. What is it exactly you believe? Or what precisely is your position? Please clarify it for me because I want to understand. How did you arrive at that belief or position? Did you always believe that or is this a new position that you hold? What is the source for your belief? Is it a reliable source? Are you sure? What if this source for your belief or position turned out to be unreliable or even wrong? Would you change your mind? What would it take to change your mind? This final point is crucial. Very few of us change our minds, especially on issues and beliefs that are important to our core self. The way we define ourselves. Before you ask that last question I want you to determine if the belief the person holds is so important to the core of their being that they'll probably never change their model. If you determine that in fact, the point of the conversation does not involve one of these core beliefs, then there's a chance the person will consider changing their mind. So clarifying precisely what it would take to get them to change their mind is vital to communicating through disagreement. Here I want you to probe a little deeper on the question what would it take to change your mind. For example you might try asking would you change your mind if you knew that the source of your position is wrong? Would you change your mind if the facts changed? Please can you tell me what precisely it would take to change your mind? These tools are especially important for finding common ground, and this is important. You have to be willing to reciprocate. That is I want you to tell the other person that you're willing to change your mind if the facts change even if you don't believe it at the time."

    "text": "Dealing with strong emotions\nAmong the myriad of human emotions anger, resentment, and even hatred are arguably the most dangerous, because they can so readily lead to massive disagreement in communication. Sometimes they are the result of disagreement. Either way, we need to learn how to deal with these feelings, because if we don't and disagreement leads to anger, or vice versa, the conversation is over. One of my personal heroes is Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who practiced nonviolent resistance to the Jim Crow laws that he and much of the African American community experienced in the mid 20th century, when the civil rights movement picked up momentum. Dr. King and his people encountered such blatant racism that few of us would reproach them for expressing anger, even hatred, at those who called them racial epithets, spat on them on the street, beat them behind buildings, and other unspeakable things. But Dr. King realized that as he told an audience at a 1958 speech, \"Hate begets hate, violence, begets violence, \"toughness begets greater toughness. \"We must meet the forces of hate with the power of love.\" And again, in a 1963 speech, \"Darkness cannot drive out darkness, \"only light can do that. \"Hate cannot drive out hate, \"only love can do that. \"Hate multiplies hate, violence multiplies violence, \"and toughness multiplies toughness \"in a descending spiral of destruction.\" When conversations spiral into disagreement and people's emotions begin to rise anger is not far behind. And where anger lurks hatred is not far behind. I've been guilty of this myself and I'll bet you have as well. So here's what I'd like you to do when you feel anger coming on during a conversation. First, monitor your emotions. Ask yourself, do I just disagree with this person? Or am I actually becoming angry with them? Then focus on the argument the person is making, not on what might seem like their intention to make you angry. Take a moment to deescalate your emotions by focusing purely on the ideas being discussed instead of the person discussing them. Try to be silent and let the other person talk while your emotional temperature comes down. It's always a good idea to take a break. If things are heating up so much that you don't think you can deescalate your emotions, walk away for a few minutes. You can simply excuse yourself for a bathroom break, go outside for some fresh air. You could even be honest and say, I'm getting really angry at the moment, so I'm going to take a break for five minutes. Finally, you can always exit entirely if none of the other tools work and you feel like you're losing control of your emotions, leave. You can just say something like, let's continue this conversation another day, or I'm done with this conversation, and then just turn and walk away. Remember these tools and use them the next time you find yourself feeling strong emotions."

    "text": "Refractory period\nPsychologists who study anger have discovered what they call a refractory period. A period of time in which your nervous system is so ramped up, that it takes some time to return to normal. This could be anywhere from five minutes to five hours to five days or longer, depending on how angry you are and what it is you're angry about. This is where the old advice of counting to 10 comes from. That's a refractory period, after which ,hopefully, your anger subsides. And we're beginning to see these cooling off periods more and more. In the courts, for example, divorces now have a cooling off period. And now ever since the financial meltdown of 2009, due to the mortgage crisis, large loans now have a cooling off period. The consequences of not controlling your emotions are significant. As Groucho Marx once remarked, \"Speak when you're angry \"and you'll make the best speech you'll ever regret.\" If the anger is on the other side, that is, if you're keeping your cool and your conversation partner's getting angry, I want you to do something about that as well, because their anger is just as bad as yours for disagreement. If you detect this in your partner, here's what I'd like you to do. First, look for signs of frustration, offense, or anger in the face and voice of your partner. Next, try to deescalate your partner's anger by offering them a refractory period. Maybe suggest taking a short break. You also want to acknowledge that you understand why they're getting upset, and ask if there's anything you said or did to anger them. The question alone will likely diffuse their emotions. It's important to try to reframe the argument or rephrase what you said that made them angry. A critical step is to listen, listen, and then listen some more. Do not escalate by talking more. Find some points of agreement with your partner. Something positive to say about them or their ideas. But don't sound condescending. It's important that you don't blame. Assume the best in your partner, and tell them that. Best intentions should be the default. Apologize if needed. And finally, exit, leave, walk away if necessary. As Dr. King said in his now canonized, I Have a Dream speech, \"In the process of gaining our rightful place, \"we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. \"Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom \"by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. \"We must forever conduct our struggle \"on the high plane of dignity and discipline.\" So I want you to aspire to the lofty plane of Dr. King's life of dignity and discipline."

    "text": "What would it take to change your mind?\nIn my experience, one of the best questions I've ever asked someone with whom I disagreed with is what would it take to change your mind? That question is at the very heart of the entire scientific method. It's what the philosopher of science, Karl Popper called falsification, that is Popper showed that in science, it's not possible to definitively prove true some claim because there's always the possibility that the next experiment or observation will uncover a counterexample that disproves your claim. So for example, if I say all swans are white, I can provide you with ten or even a thousand pictures of white swans from around the world. But that doesn't prove that all swans are white because there may be some corner of the world where swans are black. And sure enough, in Australia, there's black swans. And when they were discovered, it served as an example of the falsification of the theory that all swans are white. So the key to science is not proving hypothesis to be true, but trying to falsify them with counterexamples, you know, like black swans. So if your theory has not been falsified, despite many attempts to falsify it, then we can be confident that it might be true even while admitting that we haven't proven it to be true. So all scientific theories are at best provisionally true. While we always entertain the possibility that the next experiment or observation may modify it or falsify it. Thus, the key to communicating through disagreement is to establish what it would take to falsify the belief of the other person in the conversation, as well as what it would take to falsify your own belief. If you ask your conversation partner, what would it take to change your mind? And your partner says nothing will ever change my mind. Then the conversation is over. What's the point of talking in order to resolve disagreements, if the other person says, no matter what you say, they won't change their mind, but the same applies to you. If you cannot think of what it would take to change your mind, then there's no point in the other person talking to you. For this lesson, I want you to ask that question or some variation of it in future conversations with people who you disagree with on some topic, and then think of your own answer to the question of what it would take to change your mind. Because if you offer your falsification criteria, then you stand a better chance of the other person offering their own falsification criteria. Then the two of you can find a way to resolve your disagreements."

    "text": "Learning from hostage negotiators\nThere are a group of experts who are professionals at communicating through disagreement and these are hostage negotiators. These are conversations held at the highest levels of emotional trauma, when people's lives are at stake, both the hostages' and the hostage taker, and the negotiator must somehow diffuse the tensions and negotiate with the hostage taker to change their mind. This, you can imagine, is not easy to do, but how they do it provides lessons I want you to adopt in your own conversation, even if they are never as dramatic as a hostage negotiation situation. Here are some of the tools used by hostage negotiators. The first is to use minimal encouragers. Words like yeah, I see, and okay. Minimal encouragers are an effortless way to let your conversation partner know that you're listening. Another tool is mirroring or reflecting what you think the other person is saying. You can do this by repeating the last few words of what someone said. For example, if someone says, \"I'm just so sick \"and tired of these people pushing everyone around \"and trying to get their way,\" you can say, \"Get their way?\" Or consider this example. A trapped armed robber in a bank might say, - [Robber] I have to get out of here with the money. It's for my kid. It's not for me. - [Instructor] A good mirroring response would be, \"For your kid?\" To which the robber might say. - [Robber] Yeah, he's got a fever and an infection. We don't have the money for the medicine he's supposed to take. He needs the money for the medicine. - Here's an example of a poor mirroring response. You expect me to believe that it's not for you? You can generally avoid such mistakes by repeating only the last two or three words, phrasing them as questions and then letting the person talk while you listen. The goal of this application is to keep the person talking and volunteering more and more information that may become useful later in the conversation. Another tool is emotional labeling. When you emotionally label someone's feeling, you give it a name. This is similar to helping someone vent but more emphasis is placed on you labeling someone's feelings as opposed to coming up with a description together. Here's any example. A subject who is angry about a breakup says. - [Man] Nobody should get away with hurting other people this way. They're going to know what it's like. - A negotiator suggests that a good reply, using emotional labeling would be you sound pretty hurt about being left. It doesn't seem fair. This response, they explain, recognizes feelings without judging them. So these are a few tools that are used by top hostage negotiators. They can go a long way to helping you improve your communication."

    "text": "Tools for effective communication\nBefore we go, a few more things to keep in mind. Be sure to ask a lot of questions so that your conversation partner tells you even more about what they think. So that they know that you are listening and respecting them. But more importantly, so that you learn something new and grow from the conversation. Also, ask the other person what it would take for them to change their mind. Then I want you to ask yourself what it would take for you to change your mind. One of the most important things you can do to communicate through disagreement is to set up ground rules on what would settle the disagreement. Some logical flaw or factual observation that contradicts their or your position could settle the issue once and for all. Often people hold beliefs for the wrong reasons. If you can establish what those reasons are and how they can be tested or checked, you might be able to settle the disagreement factually. Always keep your emotions in check. Anger begets anger. Hatred begets hatred. Emotions will cloud your thinking and only trigger the other person to respond to your emotion with emotions of their own. I want you to monitor your emotions and the moment you sense they're building up, take a break. Count to ten. Or simply excuse yourself and walk away. Practice mirroring. I would like you to try to mirror what the other person is saying by simply repeating part of what they said back to them. A word or a clause or a sentence. Just repeat back to them what they said and end it with a question mark, a rise in your voice at the end of the sentence, like you're asking them to elaborate, which is what you want them to do so that you better understand what they're saying. And so that they feel like you're really listening to them. And finally, give your conversation partner the benefit of the doubt by practicing the principle of best intentions. That is, assuming the person you're talking to has good intentions, even if you think that they don't. If they don't, that will come out in time anyway. But if they do, and most people do have good intentions, then you will have aired on the side of being respectful. They will feel like you trust them and are really listening and both of you will feel better about taking the time and investing the energy into having a meaningful conversation."
